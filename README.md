# SimpleChecksums
Simple checksum scripts intended for comparison of checksums of the SHA vairent. Written for bash and powershell. I am not sure how far I will take these scripts. I just needed to compare a SHA512 checksum on a single file. I thought these might be useful to other people doing the same thing.
